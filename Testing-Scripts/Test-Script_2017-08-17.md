## Introduction script: 

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the designs, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?

(provide link to homepage: https://fec-stage-proxy.app.cloud.gov/)

### Homepage questions
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for?
    - Can you try to find that information with what you see here?
    - What were you doing the last time you came to the FEC website? Can you try to do that same thing again?
    - What is another reason you might come to the FEC website? Can you accomplish that goal with what you see here?

- Imagine that you heard the Commission recently discussed an issue relevant to your interests. Where would you look to find that information?

- Can you find when the commission will be meeting next?

- Imagine you were researching a committee in-depth and saw a contribution that you weren’t sure they could take. How would you find out if they were allowed to take this money?


### Data landing page questions

- **Task 1:** You’re researching Maryland’s upcoming senate race. How would you figure out who’s running?
- **Task 2:** Jon Ossoff ran for the U.S. House. You want to know how much money he spent during his house run. What would you do?
  - **Task 2A:** If you wanted to see who Jon Ossoff ran against, how would you do that?
- **Task 3:** You heard that a celebrity, Kristen Bell, donated money to some campaigns and you want to know how much and to who. How would you find out?  
- Let’s take a closer look at our data landing page. Can you tell us what your general impressions are? 

## General questions

That's all the questions I had!

- Did you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?

- Do you have any questions for me?
