## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the wireframes, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for? 

## Tasks:

Okay, now let’s look at the new content we're building. You can go ahead and open both links in the email I sent you, but we'll start by looking at the one labeled Link 1. Once you have that open, I'll also ask you to share your screen with me, so that I can see what you see. 

[user opens site and shares screen]

Great. First, I'd like to point out that this isn't a live website. What we're looking at is just a simulation of a real website, so not everything will be fully functional, although you should feel free to try to click whatever you normally would. 

We're going to start by trying to complete some tasks. I'll give you a scenario, along with a question to answer, and then you can go ahead and try to answer it using the website on your screen. Remember, there are no wrong answers, and please think out loud as you move around the site. Sound good?

[user confirms]

**SECTION 1: Two-site experience**
- Imagine that you are working for your local Republican or Democratic Party, and your committee wants to spend money in a federal election. However, you're not sure if your party committee needs to coordinate its spending with the larger, state-level party. Can you find an answer to that question? As a member of a _local_ party committeee, do you need to coordinate your spending with the _state-level_ party committee?

[user attempts task]


_if not addressed_ Before we move on to the other link I sent you, I have a one general question.
- If you could change anything about the experience you just had, what would you change?

[user responds]

Thank you. Now let's move on to the other link I sent -- the one labeled Link 2.

**SECTION 2: NAVIGATION**
Okay, for the first few questions, I'm going to ask you to take your hand off the mouse and just respond without actually clicking anything. Ready?

- What are we looking at here?
- If you could use your mouse to interact with what you see here, what would you try to interact with and how?
     - What do you expect to happen when you do that?

Okay, feel free to take control of your mouse again. I'm going to present you with a task, like before. Ready?

- Imagine that you recently had a debate with a friend about how much money was spent in federal election last November. Your friend claims that the total spending across by all the federal candidates was around one billion dollars, but you don't believe her. Can you find information about how much money was actually spent by federal candidates in the last election?

- Imagine that you work for Coca Cola. You're pretty sure that American companies can raise and spend money to support or oppose political candidates, but you're not sure how that works. Can you find information about what Coca Cola needs to do to start raising and spending money in federal elections?  

[return to the starting screen]

- You're a researcher at a university who studies the role of independent expenditures in federal elections. You're looking to download all the data you can on independent expenditures from the 2016 election cycle. How would you do that?

[return to the starting screen]

- What is a typical task you would try to complete on the FEC website? How would you do that with what you see here?


Great! We've finished with our tasks. Before I turn this around so that you can ask me some questions, I'd like to ask:
- Do you have any final thoughts about the features you clicked through today?

    
Ok, thank you for all of your help today!

- Do you have any questions for me, or any other general feedback you'd like to provide?
