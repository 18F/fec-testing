## Features tested this week:

- [Two-site experience (liger)](https://fec-feature-proxy.18f.gov/)

## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new designs we're creating. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the wireframes, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for? 

## Tasks:

Okay, now let’s look at the new content we're building. You can go ahead and open the link in the email I sent you. Once you have that open, I'll also ask you to share your screen with me, so that I can see what you see. 

[user opens site and shares screen]

Great. First, I'd like to point out that this design is still in progress, so not everything is fully functional, and not everything is exactly as it will be going forward. Still, it gives some indication of how the site might look and work in the future. We're going to start by trying to complete some tasks. I'll give you a scenario, along with a question to answer, and then you can go ahead and try to answer it using the website on your screen. Remember, there are no wrong answers, and please think out loud as you move around the site. Sound good?

[user confirms]

**Task 1**
- Can you find the party committee campaign guide?

**Task 2**
- Can you find information about how and when a candidate's committee can shut down after an election?

**Task 3**
- Can you find a way to contact the reports analysis division?

**Task 4**
- Can you find information about how a corporation can start a committee?

**Task 5**
- Can you find guidance about what to do if you receive an RFAI (request for additional information)?

**Task 6**
- What is a typical task you would try to complete on the FEC website? How would you do that with what you see here?

**Task 7**
Okay, for this next task we're going to start from the home page. [have user click logo to go to home page]. Please take your hand off the mouse for a second. I'll present you with a task, and I'd like you to tell me what your first step would be to answer it. 

- Can you find information about how to request an advisory opinion? 

[if user would go to candidate & committee services, let them do that; if they would go to legal resources, let them hover over the menu to see what they would do next, without clicking. once they have decided, take them to the corresponding page on beta.fec.gov]

**Task 8**
Okay, let's start back on the other homepage for this next task. [return to feature proxy homepage]. Again, I'm going to ask that you take your hand off the mouse and just tell me what you would do first to complete this task.

- Can you find guidance about how to file a complaint?

[if user would go to candidate & committee services, let them do that; if they would go to legal resources, let them hover over the menu to see what they would do next, without clicking. once they have decided, take them to the corresponding page on beta.fec.gov]


Great! We've finished with our tasks. Before we'd close, I'd like to ask a few general questions:

- Do you have any thoughts you want to share about the experience you clicked through today?

- Do you have any questions for me?

Ok, thank you for all of your help today!
