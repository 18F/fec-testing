## Features tested this week:

- Candidate content
   - Will be tested as [functioning site](https://beta.fec.gov/candidate-and-committee-services/)

## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the wireframes, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for? 

## Tasks:

Okay, now let’s look at the new content we're building. You can access the site with the link I sent in your email, and I'll give you the password once you have the webpage open. I'll also ask you to share your screen with me, so that I can see what you see. 

[user opens site and shares screen]

Great. First, we're going to start by trying to complete some tasks. I'll give you a scenario, along with a question to answer, and then you can go ahead and try to answer it using the website on your screen. Remember, there are no wrong answers, and please think out loud as you decide where to look and where to click. Ready?

[user confirms]


**TASK 1:**
You are a candidate running for office, and you want to loan some of your own money to your campaign. Can you find a page on this website that tells you whether or not this is possible?

**TASK 2:**
You are a treasurer for a committee, and you are reconciling your books. It looks like there is some cash missing, and you suspect that embezzlement has occurred. You aren’t sure what to do, and you came to this website looking for guidance. Can you find a page on this website that gives you more information?

**TASK 3:**
Your candidate lost the last election, and your committee is shutting down its operations. You know that this means you can’t take in any more contributions. You have some leftover computers, and you want to know if you can sell them without it counting as a contribution. Can you find a page on this website that answers this question? 

Great! We've finished with our tasks. Before we move on to our next section, I'd like to ask you a few questions:

- If you had a magic wand and could change anythinig about this website, what would you change?
    - Would you add anything to what you see here? 
    - Would you take anything away?
    

## Section title:

Okay, for the next section, I'm going to share my screen with you. 

[facilitator shares screen, showing a content outline]

You should be seeing something that looks like an outline. Are you seeing that?

[user confirms]

Okay, great. The outline you see here is a summary of the content you were just exploring. As you can see, the outline is missing a title. What title would you give it?
     - Can you tell me anything more about your suggestion?
     
Okay, thank you. Let's move to the next screen. You should now be seeing a list of other possible titles. Do you see them?

[user confirms]

Good. 
- _if the user suggested a title_ Which, if any, of these titles do you think is closest to the one you suggested? 
- _whether or not the user suggested a title_ What (other) thoughts do you have about the options presented here? 

Ok, thank you! That's all of the questions that I had. 

- Do you have any final thoughts you want to share, or any questions for me?

[respond to users thoughts/questions]

Okay, we're all finished. We will be doing additional testing in the future and would love to have you participate, if you are interested. Thank you for your time, and, if you be interested in participating in the future, or if you know anyone else who might, please let me know.
