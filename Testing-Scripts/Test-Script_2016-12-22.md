## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign. We are in the process of redesigning the home page for the FEC website, so we won’t be showing you a live webpage today. Instead, we’re going to look at a an in-progress version of it.

You should have received a link from me, in an email, and you can open that link now. Please let me know when you've found it and have accessed it.

[wait for user to confirm]

Okay, before ask any questions, I also want to make it clear that we're testing our designs; we're not testing you. And, although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the website. Please describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the prototype, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- What brought you to the FEC website when you visited last?
- When you’re coming to a website like the FEC’s, what do you typically expect from the homepage?

## Questions:

Okay, for the next section, we will look at the wesbite, and I'll ask you some questions about it. To do that, we'll have you share your screen, so we can see what you're seeing.

Does that sound okay?

[user confirms - wait for them to share screen]

So, the first question I have is:

- What is your first impression of this website?

- You mentioned earlier you were trying to [do something specific] the last time you visited the FEC website. Please try to complete that same task and remember to think out loud as much as possible.

- Let's scroll back to the top. For the next question, I'll present you with a scenario, and then ask what you would do in that situation. Are you ready?

[user confirms]

Okay, here's the scenario: You know that the FEC collects detailed information about how presidential campaigns are funded. You came to the FEC's website because you want to find out where Hillary Clinton's campaign funds came from. What would you do? Remember that you are welcome to click and scroll as you normally would, but please think out loud.
    - [if not already addressed] Let's take a more detailed look at the financial data section. Would anything here help you complete your task?

- Okay, let's scroll back up for another scenario. What would you do if you wanted to know who a specific person--for example, your boss or your sister--is contributing money to?

- Another scenario: Imagine that you work closely with the FEC, and so you like to keep track of what they're up to. You're here to find and to read the latest news about the FEC. What would you do?
    - [if not addressed] Let's take a look at the information in the "What's Happening" section. Would any of this be helpful to you?

- Let's scroll back to the top, and I'll present you with another scenario. There are only 2 left! Imagine that you work for a committee that is running a political campaign. All of the campaigning your team is doing is expensive, and you are responsible for filing reports to the FEC about the money your committee is spending. You don't know much about how to do that, so you came to the FEC website today looking for guidance. What would you do?
    - [if not yet addressed] Let's take a look at the information in the "candidate and committee services" section. Does the information in this section seem helpful?

- Okay, we'll scroll back up. Last scenario! Imagine that you are working for a Senator who is currently campaigning for re-election. An organization has recently offered the Senator money to speak at an upcoming event, and you want to if it's legally okay for her to donate the payment to charity. What would you do to begin answering this question?
    - [if not yet addressed] Let's take a look at the information in the "Legal resources" section. Does the information in this section seem helpful?

- Okay, we're finished with our scenarios, and I'd just like to draw your attention toward the bottom of the page. There is a section there about the Commissioners of the FEC. Is the information here of interest to you?

That's all I had for specific questions. Now we just have a few general questions before we wrap up.

- If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about this design, what would you change?

- Does this homepage design help you to understand the kinds of things you can do on the FEC website?

- Do you have any final thoughts you want to share about the design, or any questions for me?
