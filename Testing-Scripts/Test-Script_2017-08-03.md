## Introduction script: 

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the designs, Iâ€™d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for?
    - Can you try to find that information with what you see here?
    - What were you doing the last time you came to the FEC website? Can you try to do that same thing again?
    - What is another reason you might come to the FEC website? Can you accomplish that goal with what you see here?

- Imagine that you heard the Commission discussed an issue relevant to your interests in a prior meeting. Where would you look to find that information?

- If you wanted to see when the Commission is meeting next, how would you find that information? 

- What is being discussed at the next commission meeting?


## General questions

That's all the questions I had!

- Did you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?

- Do you have any questions for me?
