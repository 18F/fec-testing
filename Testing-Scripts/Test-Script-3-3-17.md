## Features tested this week:

- Two-site experience
- Search prototype

## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the wireframes, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for? 

## Tasks:

Okay, now let’s look at the new content we're building. You can access the site with the link I sent in your email. I'll also ask you to share your screen with me, so that I can see what you see. 

[user opens site and shares screen]

Great. First, we're going to start by trying to complete some tasks. I'll give you a scenario, along with a question to answer, and then you can go ahead and try to answer it using the website on your screen. Remember, there are no wrong answers, and please think out loud as you decide where to look and where to click. Ready?

[user confirms]


**TASK 1:**
Pick one of the 2016 presidential candidates and look up how much money they raised during their presidential campaign. 

**TASK 2:**
Find out who ran for senate in Ohio in 2016.


Okay, for the next task, I'm going to ask that you take your hand off the mouse for a second. After I read the task, I'd like you to just tell me in words what you would do to answer it, but without actually touching the site. Ready?

**TASK 3:**
You are working as a treasurer for a political action committee, and you are responsible for submitting financial reports to the FEC. Try to find out when the next report is due. 

[user responds with how they would start the task. if they would search, let them search. if they would go to registration and reporting, then stop them and send them the invision link].

[Either way, eventually direct the user to the InVision link]
- Okay, so, using what you see here now, go ahead and try to complete the task. Feel free to let me know if you'd like me to repeat it.

[When the user is on the reporting deadlines page] Do me a favor and scroll to the bottom of this page. Great. What do you think that gray box means? Where does that link go? 
- [probe if needed] Feel free to click that link. Where did it take you?

Great! We've finished with our tasks, and we're going to move on to something a little different. For this part, I'm going to share my screen with you. 

[facilitator shares screen, showing a content outline]

You should be seeing something that looks like an outline. Are you seeing that?

[user confirms]

Okay, great. The outline you see here is a summary of the content you were just exploring. As you can see, the outline is missing a title. What title would you give it?
     - Can you tell me anything more about your suggestion?
     
Okay, thank you. Let's move to the next screen. You should now be seeing a list of other possible titles. Do you see them?

[user confirms]

Good. 
- _if the user suggested a title_ Which, if any, of these titles do you think is closest to the one you suggested? 
- _whether or not the user suggested a title_ What (other) thoughts do you have about the options presented here? 


[if there is time and the user is interested in compliance]

**TASK 1:**
You are a candidate running for office, and you want to loan some of your own money to your campaign. Can you find a page on this website that tells you whether or not this is possible?

**TASK 2:**
You are a treasurer for a committee, and you are reconciling your books. It looks like there is some cash missing, and you suspect that embezzlement has occurred. You aren’t sure what to do, and you came to this website looking for guidance. Can you find a page on this website that gives you more information?

**TASK 3:**
Your candidate lost the last election, and your committee is shutting down its operations. You know that this means you can’t take in any more contributions. You have some leftover computers, and you want to know if you can sell them without it counting as a contribution. Can you find a page on this website that answers this question? 

Great! We've finished with our tasks. Before we move on to our next section, I'd like to ask you a few questions:

- If you had a magic wand and could change anythinig about this website, what would you change?
    - Would you add anything to what you see here? 
    - Would you take anything away?
    
---

Ok, thank you! That's all of the questions that I had. 

- Do you have any final thoughts you want to share, or any questions for me?

[respond to users thoughts/questions]

Okay, we're all finished. We will be doing additional testing in the future and would love to have you participate, if you are interested. Thank you for your time, and, if you be interested in participating in the future, or if you know anyone else who might, please let me know.
