## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign. We are in the process of redesigning the home page for the FEC website, so we won’t be showing you a real, live webpage today. Instead, we’re going to look at a prototype, which looks like a real site, but has more limited functionality.

We like to talk with people like you at this stage in our process so that we can identify possible problems early on, before we’ve gone to the trouble of actually developing everything.

Is this all making sense so far?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

Okay, before we look at the prototype, I also want to make it clear that we're testing the design, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the prototype. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the prototype, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- What brought you to the FEC website when you visited last?
- When you’re coming to a website like the FEC’s, what do you typically expect from the homepage?

## Questions:

Okay, for the next section, we will look at the prototype, and I'll ask you some questions about it.

Feel free to scroll and to click on things as much as you'd like, but know that some things might not be functional. As a reminder, it will help us a lot if you can speak out loud about what you're thinking, like "I'm clicking on the logo at the top hoping it will take me where I want to go," or "I'm still scrolling because I don't see what I'm looking for yet.

Does that sound okay?

[user confirms]

Great. Let's open the prototype.

[user opens the prototype and shares screen]

So, the first question I have is:

- You mentioned earlier you were trying to [do something specific] the last time you visited the FEC website. How, if at all, would you go about doing that same thing with what you see here? Please remember to think out loud as you proceed.

- Toward the top of the page, there are three columns containing little images and some text. What purpose do you think these items serve?
    - [if not already addressed] How, if at all, do you think you can interact with them? (What do you think they do?)
        - Feel free to test them. What do you think of the result?

- How, if at all, do you think this page could help you to explore the FEC's campaign finance data?
    - Let's take a more detailed look at the financial data section. What, if anything, are these blue boxes doing for you?
    - What kind of action can you take with each blue box?
        - Let's test out the actions and see if the results are what you expected.
    - What do you think of the information that appears outside of the blue boxes?
        - Try clicking the links there. Is this what you expected to see?

- Let's scroll back up to the top. Imagine that you work closely with the FEC, and so you like to keep track of what they're up to and what kind of activities are going on there. How, if at all, does this page help you do that?
    - [if not addressed] What do you think of the information in the "What's Happening" section?
    - What do you think will happen if you click on the different links in "what's happening"?
      - Try clicking the links there. Is this what you expected to see?

- Let's scroll back to the top, and I'll present you with a scenario. Imagine that you are part of a committee that is running a political campaign for a Senator. Your committee is doing all the stuff you need to do to run a campaign: you're making signs, printing flyers, and holding events. Of course, all of that stuff costs money, and you are responsible for filing reports to the FEC about the money the committee is spending. You don't know much about how to do this, so you came to the FEC website for help. Now that you're here, what would you do? I can repeat the scenario, if you'd like.
    - What do you think of the "candidate and committee services" section?
       - Do the links in this section seem helpful?
       - When you click them, what do you think of what you see?
       - What do you think of the red boxes?

- Let's scroll back to the top, and I'll give you another scenario. Imagine that you are still working for a Senator's campaign. You know that there are lots of complicated laws about how you can accept money from people and groups, and you don't want to accidentally do something illegal. If you came here to get more guidance about what is legal and what isn't, what would you do?
    - What do you think of the "campaign finance law" section?
    - Do the links in this section seem helpful?
    - When you click them, what do you think of what you see?
    - What do you think of the blue boxes?


- Let's scroll back up for a final scenario. Imagine that you came to this website because you want to register to vote. What would you do?

- Okay, we're finished with our scenarios. Toward the bottom of the page, there is a section about the Commissioners of the FEC. What do you think of this section?
    - Are you interested in clicking anything?
       - If so, what do you expect will happen?

- Is there anything you would change about this design?

   - If you had a magic wand and could make this page do anything you wanted, is there something special you would make it would do?

- Does this homepage design help you to understand the kinds of things you can do on the FEC website?

- Do you have any final thoughts you want to share about the design, or any questions for me?
