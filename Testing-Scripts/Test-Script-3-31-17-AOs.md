## Features tested this week:

- AO filters


## Tasks:

- Imagine that you want to review all AOs that deal with foreign nationals. Using what you see here, what would you do?

- Imagine that you are just starting some research about candidate loan forgiveness, which you know is addressed by regulatory citation 116.11 and 116.12. Using what you see here, how would you begin your search?

- Think of an AO -- any specific AO that you can recall. Can you look up that AO?

- Can you find AOs about bitcoins that were issued in 2014 or later?

- Think of a research task you completed recently. How would you do that with what you see here?

## General questions

That's it for the tasks. So, we can finish up with a general feedback request:

- Are there any other thoughts you'd like to add about the features you clicked through today?

- Do you have any questions for me?

Thank you!
