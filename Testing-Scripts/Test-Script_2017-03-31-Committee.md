## Features tested this week:

- Committee pages

## Introduction script: 

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the designs, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for? 

## Tasks:

Okay, let's take a look at the designs. For this, I'm going to ask you to share your screen with me. [user shares screen].

Great, now, in your browser, please go to wwww.beta.fec.gov. [user brings up the site]

Perfect- thanks! So, before I present you with the first task, I want to point out something that you may already know. Candidates don’t raise money in federal elections; they have committees that raise money for them. We're going to pretend we're interested looking at some financial activity for a candidate named Charlene Albarran, so we need to look up her committee.

The first task is: 
- Can you find Charlene Albarran's committee? If you'd like me to spell her name, just let me know. 

[eventually get user to Charlene Alberran's committee page]

- When everyday people gave money to this candidate’s committee, how much money did they typically give -- was it small or large amounts?

- Who is the treasurer for this committee?

- What’s the most recent report that the committee has submitted to the FEC?
    - Can you save this report to your commputer?

- How much money did the candidate (Charlene Albarran) give to her own committee?

Okay, let’s switch gears and try to find some information about Obama. 

- Can you look up Obama’s committee?
- How much money did his committee spend in 2008?


[If there is time] 

Alright, we have one section left. I'm going to send a link to your email. You are welcome to stop sharing your screen for a moment while you open it, if you want. Just let me know when you have opened the link, and we can share screens again.

[once screen is shared]

Alright. We're looking at a page about Hillary Clinton, who was a presidential candidate last year. I have a couple of tasks for you here. The first one is:

- As I'm sure you know, there are various groups that spend money to help or to hurt someone's chances of winning the election. Can you find out the names of some groups that were trying to prevent Hillary from getting elected?

- How much money did everyday people in Illinois give to Hillary?

## General questions

That's all the questions I had!

- Did you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?

- Do you have any questions for me?
