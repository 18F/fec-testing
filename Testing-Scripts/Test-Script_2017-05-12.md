## Features tested this week:

- Site-wide search
- Candidate pages

## Introduction script: 

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the designs, Iâ€™d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for? 

## Tasks:

### Site-wide search

Okay, let's take a look at the designs. For this, I'm going to ask you to share your screen with me. [user shares screen].

Great, now, in your browser, please go to wwww.beta.fec.gov. [user brings up the site]

Perfect- thanks! 

Alright, so, for the first question, I'm going to have you tell me what you think you would do to answer it, but don't actually click anything. 


- Think of one of your Congressional representatives, or just any member of Congress who comes to mind. Do you have someone in mind? Okay, if you wanted to know more about how much money that candidate's campaign is raising and spending, what would you do?
    - [if not already using search bar, prompt user to try that]

- If you were wanted to know who one of your neighbors or family members (or any specific person) donated money to in the last presidential election, what would you do to find out?
    - [if not already using search bar, prompt user to try that -- use the name Kate Hudson as an example]

- If you were working for a campaign and you wanted to know about your next reporting deadline, what would you do?
    - [if not already using search bar, prompt user to try that]

- What were you looking for the last time you came to the FEC website? [user responds] Okay, what would you do to find that information with what you see here?
    - [if not already using search bar, prompt user to try that]
 
### Candidate pages

Okay, let's take a look at the designs. For this, I'm going to ask you to share your screen with me. [user shares screen].

Great, now, in your browser, please go to wwww.beta.fec.gov. [user brings up the site]

Perfect- thanks! 

Alright, so the first task is:

- As you may know, different groups of people can spend money during an election to try to help or to prevent a specific candidate from winning. Can you find the names of some groups that were trying to help or hurt Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election? 

- Did Hillary contribute any of her own money to her campaign? 

- How much money did everyday people in Illinois give to Hillary? If you wanted to know more about who those people were, how would you find out?

- Mike Bishop is a member of Congress. Can you find out what state and district he represents? 

- George W. Bush ran for president in 2000. During that election, how much total money did his committees spend?


## General questions

That's all the questions I had!

- Did you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?

- Do you have any questions for me?
