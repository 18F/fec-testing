## Introduction script:
Hi, I'm ___, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?
[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:
Before we take a look at the website, I’d first like to ask a few things:

What is your background?
Do you visit the FEC website often?
When you come to the FEC’s website, what kinds of information are you looking for?
## Contact page questions
**Task 1:** When you have a question for the FEC, what would you do?
*If they don’t interact with the site, ask them Task number 2. If they do, skip to number 3.*

**Task 2:** Using our website, how would you do that?
**Task 3:** If you want someone to come talk to your group, what email would you use?
**Task 4:** You’re looking for a registered committee, but you can’t find it on our website, who would you reach out in order to find the committee?
*Prompt them to tell us why they selected that department over another. “Why did you choose that department?” 

When you speak with someone at the FEC, who do you speak with most frequently?
Do you have any general impressions of this page?
## Contact your Analyst questions
**Task 5:** You have a question about your committee and want to speak to your analyst. How would you find his or her information?
**Task 6:** Instead of calling your analyst, you’d like to send them a message. How would you do that?
Do you have any general impressions of this page?
## General questions
Those are all the questions I had!

Are there any questions you wish I asked you but didn’t?
Did you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?
Do you have any questions for me?
