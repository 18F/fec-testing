## Features tested this week:

- [Two-site experience (liger)](https://fec-feature-proxy.18f.gov/)

## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new designs we're creating. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the wireframes, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for? 

## Tasks:

Okay, now let’s look at the new content we're building. You can go ahead and open the link in the email I sent you. Once you have that open, I'll also ask you to share your screen with me, so that I can see what you see.

Great. First, I'd like to point out that this design is still in progress, so not everything is fully functional, and not everything is exactly as it will be going forward. Still, it gives some indication of how the site might look and work in the future. We're going to start by trying to complete some tasks. I'll give you a scenario, along with a question to answer, and then you can go ahead and try to answer it using the website on your screen. Remember, there are no wrong answers, and please think out loud as you move around the site. Sound good?

**Task 7**
- What is a typical task you would try to complete on the FEC website? How would you do that with what you see here?


Great! We've finished with our tasks. Before we'd close, I'd like to ask a few general questions:

- Do you have any final thoughts about the features you clicked through today?

- Do you have any questions for me, or any other general feedback you'd like to provide?

Ok, thank you for all of your help today!
