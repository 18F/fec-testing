## Introduction script:
*Start by asking how much time they have. That will help gauge how many mini-tests you can conduct. It will also reflect well on us, having taken the time to ask and respecting their time.

Hi, I'm ___, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get some quick feedback on new features and content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here and all your answers will be the right ones. Also, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.
Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us. Sound good?
[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:
What is your job in campaign finance?
How long have you been in the industry?
Topic questions:

### New H4CC landing page
This test needs to be done on dev. Have user go to: https://fec-dev-proxy.app.cloud.gov/ 

Mini-test 1: Landing page findability (starting on website homepage)
You received a contribution that is excessive. What steps would you take to handle this?
Mini-test 2: Usability of the landing page (starting on landing page)
You’ve just started on a new campaign, and want to stay on top of when reports are due. Can you try to find that information based on what you see here?
Your committee received a strange contribution, and you want to know whether is it permissible. Can you find a page on this website that tells you whether or not this is possible? 



### Contact FEC
Mini-test 1: Navigation to contact page (starting on homepage)
You can’t remember whether green card holders can make contributions and want to call someone at the FEC to check. Can you try to find a page on the website with FEC phone numbers?
Mini-test 2: Navigation to RAD contact form (if already on contact page from last test, start there, otherwise, start from homepage)
We now have tool to send your analyst a message should you need to contact them. How would you find that form to send your analyst a message?

### Candidate Reporting Examples (for campaign filers)
These are the names of different types of receipts and expenditures and clicking on one will show you how to report them. 
Mini-test: Topic naming logic (start from homepage)
A family friend paid for a tent at one of your candidate’s outdoor events. Which, if any, of these would you look at to learn how to report that information?
Do you notice anything missing?

### AO/MUR Boolean Search (for lawyers if you see them)
Mini-test: Usability of more keyword options (start from AO search)
Using what you see here, how would you conduct a more advanced search?

## Closing questions:
Are there any questions you wish I asked you but didn’t?
Any other feedback to share?
Do you have any questions for me?
