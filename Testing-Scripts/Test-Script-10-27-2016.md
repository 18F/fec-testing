## Features tested this week:

- Homepage wireframes
   - Will be tested as flat PDFs (facilitator will share their screen)

## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign. We are currently in the early stages of redesigning the home page for the FEC website, so we won’t be showing you a real, live webpage today. Instead, we’re going to look at some really basic designs that we call “wireframes.”

We like to talk with people like you at this stage in our process so that we can identify possible problems early on, before we’ve gone to the trouble of stylizing and developing everything.

It might be helpful to think of the wireframes like blueprints for a house: They are like the “skeleton” of a webpage. The wireframes will be black and white, and they won’t contain a lot of detail. There will be nothing to click on, and nothing will be interactive.  Essentially, we’re just starting to sketch out the basics of how the homepage could work and what kinds of information it could contain.

Is this all making sense so far?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

Okay, before we look at the wireframes, I also want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the wireframes, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What brought you to the FEC website when you visited last?
	- What is your background?
- When you’re coming to a website like the FEC’s, what do you typically expect from the homepage?

## Questions for wireframe option 1:

Okay, now let’s look at the first design. I am going to share my screen with you and show it to you on my computer.

[share screen]

- As we stay scrolled to the top of the screen, what is your first impression of the page?

- Does the happening soon section contain the kind of information you would expect to see?

- I'm going to go back to the top now for the next question. If you would like me to scroll, feel free to tell me. The question is: What would you do if you worked for a candidate's campaign, and you wanted to know more about how to file your required reports with the FEC?

    - _if not already addressed_ How would you expect the section labeled “What can we help you do”? to function?
        - Does this section of the page seem useful?


-  Let's scroll back to the top. As you may know, the FEC deals with campaign finance for federal elections, and it does not oversee state-level campaigns. However, people often make the mistake of asking the FEC about state-level issues. If you came to the FEC website with a state-level question, what would be your expectations?
    - Would the information on this page be helpful to you?


- What thoughts do you have about using this page to stay informed about what is going on at the FEC?
    - How do you expect the “latest updates” section to work?
    - What do you think about seeing the blurb beneath the headlines? Is that useful?


- Thinking about the page as a whole, does it seem like there is anything missing?

- Is there anything you would change about it?

## Questions for wireframe option 2:

Okay, great. We're finished with the first design.  Let's take a look at the second one.

I'm going to adjust my screen for a moment to bring up the second wireframe.

- Okay, here we go. As we stay scrolled to the top of the screen, what is your first impression of the page?

- As we continue scrolling, what thoughts do you have about the financial data section?
	- Is the information here useful?
	- Would you change something about it?


- I'm going to go back to the top now for the next question. If you would like me to scroll, feel free to tell me. The question is: What would you do if you worked for a candidate's campaign, and you wanted to know more about how to file your required reports with the FEC?

    - _if not already addressed_, how would you expect the “Who do you need information for” section to function?
	    - Does this section of the page seem useful?


- Let’s scroll back to the top. Recalling that the FEC does not deal with state-level campaigns, if you came to the website seeking that information, would the information on this page be helpful to you?

- Thinking about this page as a whole, does it seem like there is anything missing?

- Is there anything you would change about it?

## Closing questions:

Okay, we're finished looking at the second design, and I just have a few closing questions for you.

- Thinking about both wireframes: Is there one that you prefer?
	- Does one feel more useful than the other?


- Do these homepage designs help you to understand what you can do on the FEC website?
	- Does one design do this better?


- Do you have any final thoughts you want to share about the designs, or any questions for me?
