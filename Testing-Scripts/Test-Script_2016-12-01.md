## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign. We are in the process of redesigning the home page for the FEC website, so we won’t be showing you a real, live webpage today. Instead, we’re going to look at a prototype, which looks like a real site, but has more limited functionality.

We like to talk with people like you at this stage in our process so that we can identify possible problems early on, before we’ve gone to the trouble of actually developing everything.

Is this all making sense so far?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

Okay, before we look at the prototype, I also want to make it clear that we're testing the design, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the prototype. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the prototype, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- What brought you to the FEC website when you visited last?
- When you’re coming to a website like the FEC’s, what do you typically expect from the homepage?

## Questions:

Okay, for the next section, we will look at the prototype, and I'll ask you some questions about it.

Feel free to scroll and to click on things as much as you normally would, but know that some things might not be functional. As a reminder, it will help us a lot if you can speak out loud about what you're thinking, like "I'm clicking on the logo at the top hoping it will take me where I want to go," or "I'm still scrolling because I don't see what I'm looking for yet.

Does that sound okay?

[user confirms]

Great. Let's open the prototype.

[user opens the prototype and shares screen]

So, the first question I have is:

- You mentioned earlier you were trying to [do something specific] the last time you visited the FEC website. Please try to complete that same task and remember to think out loud as much as possible.

- Let's scroll back to the top for the next scenario. You know that the FEC collects detailed information about how presidential campaigns are funded. You came to the FEC's website because you want to find out which organizations gave money to Hillary Clinton. What would you do? Remember that you are welcome to click and scroll as you normally would, but please think out loud.
    - [if not already addressed] Let's take a more detailed look at the financial data section. Would anything here help you complete your task?
    - What would you do if you wanted to know who a specific person--for example, your boss or your sister--is contributing money to?
    - Before we move on, let's take a look at some of the other things you can do in this section. For [this thing we haven't yet discussed], what do you expect would happen if you click the link?

- Let's scroll back up to the top. Imagine that you work closely with the FEC, and so you like to keep track of what they're up to. You're here to find and to read the latest news about the FEC. What would you do?
    - [if not addressed] Let's take a look at the information in the "What's Happening" section. Would any of this be helpful to you?
    - [if not addressed] What do you think will happen if you click on the different links that you see in "what's happening"?

- Let's scroll back to the top, and I'll present you with another scenario. Imagine that you work for a committee that is running a political campaign. All of the campaigning your team is doing is expensive, and you are responsible for filing reports to the FEC about the money your committee is spending. You don't know much about how to do that, so you came to the FEC website today looking for guidance. What would you do?
    - [if not yet addressed] Let's take a look at the information in the "candidate and committee services" section. Does the information in this section seem helpful?
        - [if not addressed] Do the red boxes that appear here seem useful?

- Let's scroll back up, and I will change the scenario a bit. Instead of working for a committee running a campaign, imagine that you are working for a corporation that wants to donate money to a specific candidate. You aren't sure where to begin, so you came to the FEC website. What would you do?

- Okay, we'll scroll back up. Only two scenarios left! Imagine that you are working for a Senator who is currently campaigning for re-election. An organization has recently offered the Senator money to speak at an upcoming event, and you want to if it's legally okay for her to donate the payment to charity. What would you do to begin answering this question?
    - [if not yet addressed] Let's take a look at the information in the "campaign finance law" section. Does the information in this section seem helpful?

- Let's scroll back up for a final scenario. Imagine that you came to this website because you want to register to vote. What would you do?

- Okay, we're finished with our scenarios, and I'd just like to draw your attention toward the bottom of the page. There is a section there about the Commissioners of the FEC. Is the information here of interest to you?
    - Are you interested in clicking anything here?

That's all I had for specific questions. Now we just have a few general questions before we wrap up.

- Is there anything you would change about this design?

- Does this homepage design help you to understand the kinds of things you can do on the FEC website?

- Do you have any final thoughts you want to share about the design, or any questions for me?
