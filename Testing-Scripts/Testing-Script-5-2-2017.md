## Features tested this week:

- Candidate pages
- Main navigation
- Committee pages

## Introduction script: 

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the designs, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for? 

## Tasks:

### Candidate pages

Okay, let's take a look at the designs. For this, I'm going to ask you to share your screen with me. [user shares screen].

Great, now, in your browser, please go to wwww.beta.fec.gov. [user brings up the site]

Perfect- thanks! 

Alright, so the first task is:

- As you may know, different groups of people can spend money during an election to try to help or to prevent a specific candidate from winning. Can you find the names of some groups that were trying to help or hurt Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election? 

- Did Hillary contribute any of her own money to her campaign? 

- How much money did everyday people in Illinois give to Hillary? If you wanted to know more about who those people were, how would you find out?

- Mike Bishop is a member of Congress. Can you find out what state and district he represents? 

- George W. Bush ran for president in 2000. During that election, how much total money did his committees spend?

### Navigation

- Switching gears a little bit....can you find out if there are any elections coming up near you? 

- You work for a candidate's authorized committee and have received a donation from a foreign national. You want to know if you can accept that donation or not. Can you find the answer to that question using this website?

- Imagine that you're a journalist. Can you find the FEC's most recent press release?

- You work for a corporation that is interested in raising money to support a candidate. Can you find any information on this website to help get you started?

- Okay, next question. You want to know how the law defines a "charitable donation." What would you do?

- Who are the current commissioners of the FEC?


### If there's time: Committee questions (repeats from last time)

Okay, last section. We're going to look at some information related to a candidate named Charlene Alberran. 

- Can you find Charlene Albarran's committee? If you'd like me to spell her name, just let me know. 

[eventually get user to Charlene Alberran's committee page]

- When everyday people gave money to this candidate’s committee, how much money did they typically give -- was it small or large amounts?

- Who is the treasurer for this committee?

- What’s the most recent report that the committee has submitted to the FEC?
    - Can you save this report to your computer?


## General questions

That's all the questions I had!

- Did you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?

- Do you have any questions for me?
