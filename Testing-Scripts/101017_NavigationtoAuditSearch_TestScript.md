## Features tested this week:
Audit Reports 
Navigating to audit search
New audit designs
Open-ended feedback
## Introduction script:
Hi, I'm ___, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new search features we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the website, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.
Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.
Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?
[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

### Introduction questions:
Before we take a look at the website, I’d first like to ask a few things:
How often do you use the audit search on FEC.gov as a part of your work?
What prompts you to conduct an audit search on FEC.gov?
What kind of information are you hoping to gather when you conduct an audit search?
### Audit search questions
**Task 1:** FEC.gov: Can you walk me through the steps you typically take to find what you were looking for when conducting an audit search? (Probe to find out whether search is usually conducted to find a specific audit, or audits that reference specific findings or issues?) 
**Task 2:** Classic: Can you walk me through the steps you would typically take to find what you were looking for when conducting an audit search? 
(Probe to find out whether search is usually conducted to find a specific audit, or audits that reference specific findings or issues?)
Do you have any general impressions of the current audit search?

### New audit design questions
InVision prototype
*Show tester mock-ups of audit search page*
Before we take a closer look at this page, what is your general impression?
**Task 3:** Looking at this new design, how would you begin your search? 
**Task 4:** What would you expect to happen if you clicked on American Financial Services Association PAC there in the search results?
*Move on to audit report landing page.*
**Task 5:** Go to the Gary Johnson - 2012 audit report.
**Task 6:** You’ve found the audit you’re looking for, can you select the final report?
What are your general impressions of this audit report page?
Is there anything you expected to see, but did not?
### General questions
Those are all the questions I had!
Are there any questions you wish I asked you but didn’t?
Do you have any questions for me?
