## Features tested this week:

- Candidate section designs (InVision)
- Candidate compliance content outline

## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign, and we'd like to get your feedback on some new content we're adding. Before we start, I want to make it clear that we're testing the designs, not you. You can't do anything wrong here - all answers are the right answers.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you look at the designs. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Finally, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. Sound good?

[wait for user confirmation; clarify things if user asks questions]

## Introduction questions:

Before we take a look at the new designs, I’d first like to ask a few things:

- What is your background?
- Do you visit the FEC website often?
- When you come to the FEC's website, what kinds of information are you looking for? 

## Questions:

Okay, now let’s look at the new site we're building. You can access the site by going to beta.fec.gov.

[user opens site and shares screen]

Great. First, we're going to start by trying to complete a couple of tasks. I'll give you a scenario, along with a question to answer, and then you can go ahead and try to answer it using the website on your screen. Remember, there are no wrong answers, and please think out loud as you decide where to look and where to click. Ready?

[user confirms]


**TASK 1:**
- A person named Tammy Baldwin is running for senate in Wisconsin. You want to know if there are any organizations or groups who are spending money to help her win. Without clicking anything, can you tell me how you would begin to answer this question? 

    - _Allow user to explain their preferred path. If the path involves accessing the candidate page, then stop the user and send a link to the InVision. Explain that the mockup is not fully functional. Regardless of the user's initial path, eventually direct them to the Candidate InVision._ 
    - Using these new designs, can you find information about any organizations or groups who are spending money to help Tammy Baldwin win the election?

**TASK 2:**
- Lots of everyday people give money to Tammy Baldwin’s campaign. You recently heard Tammy Baldwin give a speech, and she said that most of the money she raised came from people who gave $200 or less. Is that true?

- Now that you know that Tammy Baldwin received lots of contributions for $200 or less, you want to know what the smallest contribution was. How would you find that?

**COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS**

For the next section, I'm going to ask you to return to the Financial Summary page for Tammy Baldwin. [wait for user to navigate there]

- What is this page currently showing you?
- Please tell me how, if at all, you think you can interact with the information on this page.
    - Are there things that you want to click?

Okay, last question! If you want to, you can feel free to click around in order to answer this question.
- Is Tammy Baldwin a member of a specific political party?

Great! We've finished with our tasks. Before we move on to our next section, I'd like to ask you a few questions:

- If you had a magic wand and could change anythinig about these designs, what would you change?
    - Would you add anything to what you see here? 
    - Would you take anything away?
    

## Section title:

Okay, for the next section, I'm going to share my screen with you. 

[facilitator shares screen, showing a content outline]

You should be seeing something that looks like an outline. Are you seeing that?

[user confirms]

Okay, great. The outline you see here is a summary of the content you were just exploring. As you can see, the outline is missing a title. What title would you give it?
     - Can you tell me anything more about your suggestion?
     
Okay, thank you. Let's move to the next screen. You should now be seeing a list of other possible titles. Do you see them?

[user confirms]

Good. 
- _if the user suggested a title_ Which, if any, of these titles do you think is closest to the one you suggested? 
- _whether or not the user suggested a title_ What (other) thoughts do you have about the options presented here? 

Ok, thank you! That's all of the questions that I had. 

- Do you have any final thoughts you want to share, or any questions for me?

[respond to users thoughts/questions]

Okay, we're all finished. We will be doing additional testing in the future and would love to have you participate, if you are interested. Thank you for your time, and, if you be interested in participating in the future, or if you know anyone else who might, please let me know.
